# an - Analyse Notes

Analyse the structure of notes.

This provides the subcommands `size`, `headercount`, `structure`, and `complexity`.

- `structure` - display the headers for each file
- `headercount` simply count number of headers per file
- `complexity` - heuristic on number of headers and header depth
- `size` - size in kb of each note

The aim is to be able to quickly look through notes that are covering too many topics, with the idea being that we want many small notes that each cover one specific idea well, rather than notes that cover a whole bunch of ideas.

Having many small notes lets me link ideas together in interesting ways, and link to specific ideas from other notes, rather than having to point to a header within a larger document.
